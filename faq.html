You should upgrade if you're adding hot tubs, EV chargers, major kitchen renovations, HVAC upgrades, or solar power systems. Older homes typically have 100-amp service, while modern homes require at least 200 amps."

EV manufacturers require a dedicated circuit for Level 1 and Level 2 chargers - failing to use one voids most EV battery warranties. Many homes require electrical panel upgrades to support Level 2 chargers. We assess your panel capacity during consultation and handle all permitting requirements."

Common causes include: overloaded circuits (too many high-powered appliances on one circuit), short circuits (hot and neutral wires touching, requires immediate professional attention), ground faults (hot wire contacting grounded parts, common in bathrooms and kitchens), faulty appliances (malfunctioning appliances triggering breakers), and aging systems (panels have 25-30 year lifespans). Call us immediately if your breaker trips repeatedly with nothing plugged in, or if you notice burning smells, warmth, discoloration, sparks, or buzzing sounds."

            "@type": "Answer",
            "text": "Older homes, particularly those built before the 1940s, may have knob-and-tube (K&T) wiring, which is now considered dangerous. K&T wiring hazards include: lack of grounding wire (increasing shock risk), rubber insulation that deteriorates with age and heat, cannot be covered with modern insulation per the 2008 National Electrical Code, and susceptible to overheating and fire hazards. Prioritize rewiring K&T systems in high-moisture areas first: bathrooms, kitchens, and laundry rooms. Many homeowners insurance companies refuse coverage or charge significantly higher premiums for homes with K&T wiring. We can perform a complete inspection to identify outdated wiring and recommend replacement timelines."

                            <li>Installing new circuits</li>
                            <li>Electrical panel upgrades or replacements</li>
                            <li>Rewiring projects</li>
                            <li>New outlet or switch installations</li>
                            <li>Solar installations</li>

                        <p>EV charger installation requires specific electrical work:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Level 1 (120V):</strong> Up to 20 hours for full charge (uses standard outlet)</li>
                            <li><strong>Level 2 (240V):</strong> 4-8 hours for full charge (requires dedicated circuit)</li>

                        <p>EV manufacturers require a dedicated circuit for Level 1 and Level 2 chargers - failing to use one voids most EV battery warranties.

                        <p>Older homes, particularly those built before the 1940s, may have knob-and-tube (K&T) wiring, which is now considered dangerous. K&T wiring hazards include:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Lack of grounding wire, increasing shock risk</li>
                            <li>Rubber insulation that deteriorates with age and heat</li>
                            <li>Cannot be covered with modern insulation per the 2008 National Electrical Code</li>
                            <li>Susceptible to overheating and fire hazards</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Prioritize rewiring K&T systems in high-moisture areas first: bathrooms, kitchens, and laundry rooms. Many homeowners insurance companies refuse coverage or charge significantly higher premiums for homes with K&T wiring. We can perform a complete inspection to identify outdated wiring and recommend replacement timelines.</p>
